This package does not define any keybindings at the moment. Feel free to define
your own keybindings for each command, like so:

```
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n c") 'geeknote-create)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n f") 'geeknote-find)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n l") 'geeknote-show)
```

## Alternatives/Inspiration

You can check
out
[emacs-geeknote](https://github.com/https://github.com/avendael/emacs-geeknote) if
you use evernote/geeknote.  I used to use it before evernote changed
its policy.
